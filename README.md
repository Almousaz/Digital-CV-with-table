# Requirements ðŸ“‹

1. **Integrating a Table**: Add a table to your digital CV. Consider themes like skills, software tools, languages, courses, certifications, projects, test scores, or references.
2. **Utilization of HTML Elements**: Your table should, at a minimum, use the following HTML elements:
    - `table`: Defines the table set.
    - `thead`: Groups the header content of the table, usually containing header cells (`th`).
    - `tbody`: Groups the body content of the table.
    - `tr`: Represents a table row that contains table cells (`th` or `td`).
    - `th`: Represents a header cell in a table row.
    - `td`: Represents a standard table cell that contains data or information in a table row.
3. **Conciseness and Relevance**: While the table allows for multiple types of information, it's crucial to ensure relevance. Prioritize the essentials. Ensure your table complements your CV without overwhelming it.
4. **Using Comments**: As before, incorporate comments in your HTML code to describe different sections of your table.
